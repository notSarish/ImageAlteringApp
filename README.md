# Week 1 Progress
In week 1, I successfully implemented the libraries I planned on using in my project(Eigen and OpenCV). I also made a quick demo that showed how OpenCV processed the image and converted it to an Eigen matrix. 

# Week 2 Progress
In week 2, I finished creating a model for sharpening grayscale images using a laplacian filter. I also implemented the Cinder-Block ImGui to help create a nice UI for the user. With the help of ImGui, so far I have made an application that allows the user to enter a file path, and choose how sharp they want the image to be through a slider. I also plan on making a feature where the user can rewrite the current image or make a new file of the sharpened image. I also want to make a feature where the user can compress the file if they want to. In terms of next week, I plan on implementing a similar model for colored images, but this may pose some issues as colored images are represented in terms of 3 matrices (each representing either red, green, or blue).
